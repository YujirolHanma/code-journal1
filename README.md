________________________________________________________________

### (#1) firstly I will be able to understand and use github comands from memory and memory alone,
doing so requires

#### * ****a journal entry every fort night to track said progress.****
#### * ****watching educational videos to understand the input process output of github****

# Aims that i had since the last journal entry
1.  increase wpm to decrease time spent on writing code.
- used free programs to practise typing quicker [1]
- got used to different symbols and various shortcut keys [2]
2. still working on memorizing and gettimg familiar with the commonly used codes

## fortunately as i had gone through a handful of videos given by mr.tony i hadnt come across much bugs just a few syntax errors which were pretty easy to catch on to .

# Reflection: 
i still have a long way to go before i wouldnt need to resort to google searches to figure out certain code paterns 
and certain shortcuts but by the next journal entry i wish to understand most of the fundamentaly common codes used.
